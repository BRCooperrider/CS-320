# How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

### This course was all about learning how to test code and write test cases, so the answer to this question is the best way to ensure my code is functional and secure is to test it. Before this course, I had no experience writing test cases or experience on how to test code. I knew that it was important but I didn't understand what the processes involved. Now I can say that testing is a skill that is very important for a developer to have. I want to write secure and reliable code, so writing test cases and even looking at the code from an outside perspective contributes to better development.

# How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

### I interpret user needs by making a checklist of what the user would like. There are often many requirements to follow so having a checklist with what I need helps me keep my thoughts organized and enables me to physically see when I complete a specific requirement. Sometimes it takes awhile to incorporate what they would like but that is part of the process.

# How do I approach designing software?

### My approach to designing software starts with getting a list of the requirements. That list will help guide me in knowing what I need to make. From there I will start developing the code incrementally until all of the requirements are met. Once that is completed I usually inspect and test the code to ensure it is working as intended.
